Feel free to create a new Pull request if you want to propose a new feature
or fix a bug.  

Sending pull requests
=====================

1. Fork the repo::

    https://github.com/MicroPyramid/django-mfa

2. Create a branch for your specific changes::

    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull
    $ git checkout -b feature

   To simplify things, please, make one branch per issue (pull request).
   It's also important to make sure your branch is up-to-date with upstream master,
   so that maintainers can merge changes easily.

3. Commit changes. Please update docs, if relevant.

4. Don't forget to run tests to check than nothing breaks.

5. Ideally, write your own tests for new feature/bug fix.

6. Submit a `pull request`_.
